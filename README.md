# FSDI_111_Competency_Report

Instructions

RESTful service

To complete this assignment you must create a RESTful API that allows users to create, read, update, delete and scan "notes" from a "notes" table in a database.

The notes table must contain at least these five columns: id, title, subtitle, body and created_on (datetime).

The created_on column should populate automatically on a successful "create" operation.

The id column must be of type "auto increment" and should therefore populate automatically on successful "create" operations.

In addition to what is outlined above: create a frontend that connects to your RESTful backend and graphically displays pages for all the operations mentioned above.

There should be forms for creating and updating notes, a confirmation page for deletion, a list or table of notes (scan) and a "single read" page which displays a single note accessible via a route similar to "/note/<id>".

Make sure your project uses bootstrap, contains a navbar and follows the submittal guidelines outlined in module 1 of this course.# FSDI_111_Competency_Report-
